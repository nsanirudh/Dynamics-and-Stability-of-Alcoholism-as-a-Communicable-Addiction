Implementaion on Simulink

This project is an implementation of an SEIR-type model.
STEP 1 - read the presentation
STEP 2 - read PDF with given equations
STEP 3 - .m flie is the input for the parameters in Simulink. Run it prior to running the Simulink file.
STEP 4 - Obtain graphs as attached in presentation using Simulink(Two attached files of the same model with a slight change in equations)
