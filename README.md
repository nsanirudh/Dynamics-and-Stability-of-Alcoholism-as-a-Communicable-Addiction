# Dynamics-and-Stability-of-Alcoholism-as-a-Communicable-Addiction

### This project was completed as a part of the Mathematical Modeling(MATH F420) course conduted in BITS Pilani, Goa.


## Summary

Alcoholism.pdf(https://github.com/nsanirudh/Dynamics-and-Stability-of-Alcoholism-as-a-Communicable-Addiction/blob/master/Alcoholism.pdf) and Modelling Presentation.pdf(https://github.com/nsanirudh/Dynamics-and-Stability-of-Alcoholism-as-a-Communicable-Addiction/blob/master/Modeling%20presentation.pdf) contain the used equations and the theory of this project.

## Useage
Implementaion on Simulink

* This project is an implementation of an SEIR-type model.

* STEP 1 - read the presentation

* STEP 2 - read PDF with given equations

* STEP 3 - .m flie is the input for the parameters in Simulink. Run it prior to running the Simulink file.

* STEP 4 - Obtain graphs as attached in presentation using Simulink(Two attached files of the same model with a slight change in equations)
